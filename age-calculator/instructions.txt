    // Difference in months calculation

    If the current month (m2) is greater than or equal to the birth month (m1):

        - Simply subtract the birth month from the current month: m3 = m2 - m1.

    else the current month (m2) is less than the birth month (m1):

        - Decrease the calculated year difference (y3) by 1, because we haven't yet reached the birth month in the current year.

        - Calculate the month difference by considering a full year (12 months) minus the difference between the birth month and the current month: 

        

    // Difference in days calculation

    If the current day (d2) is greater than or equal to the birth day (d1):

        - Simply subtract the birth day from the current day: d3 = d2 - d1.

    else the current day (d2) is less than the birth day (d1):

        - Decrease the calculated month difference (m3) by 1 because we haven't yet reached the birth day in the current month.
    
        - Calculate the day difference by adding the number of days in the birth month (obtained from the getDaysInMonth function) to the current day, then subtract the birth day:

    
    // adjust for negative months

    if the calculated month difference (m3) is less than 0:

        - Set m3 to 11 because the year difference (y3) would have already been decremented in the previous step, effectively resetting the months to a previous year.

        - Decrease the year difference (y3) by 1 to account for the adjusted months.



    // Displays the calculated age in the "result" element.

    results.innnerHTML = `You are ${d3<span>m3 y3} years old`

// func get days in birth month

has param of year and month

return the new date using param of year and month and 0 days then use get date func
